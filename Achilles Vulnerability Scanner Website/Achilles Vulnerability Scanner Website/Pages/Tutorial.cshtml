      <h1>Quick Guide</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This is a quick guide to explain how the vulnerability scanner works by replacing the jargon with easier to understand analogies and examples</h5>

      <p>A good analagy to think of is that the IP address is like a street with the number at the end being where the device is located e.g. "192.168.1.5" could your smartphone with it's street being "192.168.1" followed by the house number in this case "5".</p>
      <p>Another good analagy for the MAC address is that it is like a National Insurance number but for devices where it is unique to them. (This is not always true in practice for the MAC's case but it is very unlikely you will have two devices with the same MAC address in your network.</p>
      <p>Also a good note that an Operating System is just the platform that a device uses for example Microsoft's Windows for most Computers or Apple's IOS for their smartphones</p>

      <h1>Written Tutorial</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">This is a step-by-step guide for how to use the vulnerability scanner</h5>

      <p>Firstly, go to the Scans page and click the scan button</p>
      <p>Once you are here you will be given a range of options. First of all type in your IP address like the following 192.168.0.0/24. If you don't know what it is please refer to the help page. It's important to note that the first 3 sets of numbers the 192.168.0 are the most important for you to know as the last 0/24 will just look for all devices within your network. 
          If you don't know your IP address please refer to the help page for help how to find it. 
      </p>
      <p>Next you must choose one of the four scan options. Quick Scan will give you a quick and general jist of what is on the network and how vulnerable it is. Discovery scan will just find out what devices are on your network
          OS scan will tell you what Operating Systems devices on your network use plus more information about them such as if the Operating System they use is updated. Finally, the Vulnerability scan will specialise in looking for vulnerabilities that a device might have.
      </p>
      <p>Once you have entered your IP and selected your scan press submit. (Note you will have to accept a notification for the system administrator that you allow the program to proceed)</p>
      <p>The program may take a while to scan so check on it every 30 minutes or so.</p>
      <p>Once the scan is done you will be taken back to the scan page. To check if your scan was successful go to the Scan Database or the Dashboard page and look for the section for the scan you have chosen. If the time of the scan you see is from around the time you started the scan then it means the scan was successful and you can view the vulnerabilities of your network. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, if you want to view your scanned data in a more easy or user-friendly way look at the graphs and charts in the graphs or Dashboard page.</p>
